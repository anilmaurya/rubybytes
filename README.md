Welcome to Rubybytes, a disassembler for your ruby code. Inspired by a project by Matt Godbold called [GCC Explorer](https://github.com/mattgodbolt/gcc-explorer) and aimed at Ruby from a suggestion by [Pat Shaughnessy](http://patshaughnessy.net/).

Currently only targets [MRI 2.3.1](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2016/04/26/ruby-2-3-1-released/).

The demo site can be found [here](http://rubybytes.io/).
