Welcome to Rubybytes, a disassembler for your ruby code. Inspired by a project by Matt Godbold called [GCC Explorer](https://github.com/mattgodbolt/gcc-explorer) and aimed at Ruby from a suggestion by [Pat Shaughnessy](http://patshaughnessy.net/).

Currently only targets MRI 2.3, MRI 2.2, and MRI 2.1.

The demo site can be found [here](http://rubybytes.io/).
