Rubybytes
=====================================

Welcome to Rubybytes, a disassembler for your ruby code. Inspired by a project by Matt Godbold called [GCC Explorer](https://github.com/mattgodbolt/gcc-explorer) and aimed at Ruby from a suggestion by [Pat Shaughnessy](http://patshaughnessy.net/).

Currently only targets [MRI 2.1.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/05/09/ruby-2-1-2-is-released/).

The demo site can be found [here](http://rubybytes.io/).
