Rubybytes
=====================================

Welcome to Rubybytes, a disassembler for your ruby code. Inspired by a project by Matt Godbold called [GCC Explorer](https://github.com/mattgodbolt/gcc-explorer) and aimed at Ruby from a suggestion by [Pat Shaughnessy](http://patshaughnessy.net/).

An example can be found [here](http://rubybytes.herokuapp.com/).
